You will be creating a kitbot!

At the very beginning of build season (start of January), teams are given a Kit of Parts. This kit includes enough materials to make a "kitbot" - a simple drivebase capable of moving around on the field. On kickoff, there is a "quickbuild" activity held in Calgary where we do this activity with every team in the region.

The guide is found [here](http://www.simbotics.org/resources/kitbot).

After finishing your kitbot build, you will need to write a short (1 page) summary of the components and fabrication of FRC robots. Use your experience with the kitbot as an example of an FRC robot.
