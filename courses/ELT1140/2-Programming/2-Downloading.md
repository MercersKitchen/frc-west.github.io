Part of the challenge of programming is downloading code onto the robot. There are three main methods used to download code:

- Teach pendant
- Hardwire
- Wireless

## Teach Pendant
A teach pendant is a portable control device used in industrial robotics. It gives the user control over movement. This control device is programmed to send signals, and can be *re-imaged* with new control code.

## Hardwire
The most common way to download code is through a wire. Typically, there is software on the robot's end that can receive data from a wire. The robot receives the code and re-configures itself to run that code.

## Wireless
Similar to a hardwire, downloading code wirelessly sends the data through the air. This method is usually less reliable than having a hardwire because of interference. Since it is critical to send all of the data, loss of data can cause serious problems.
