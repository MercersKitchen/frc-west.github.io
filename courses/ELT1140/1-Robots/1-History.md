Over the years, there has been an evolution of what robots are and what they do. Part of understanding what exactly robots are is their history. This page will go over the stages of evolution that robots have gone through.

Something to notice is that robots are largely an assembly of existing technology. Often times, robots are not the guiding force of technology. The interesting parts of robotics history are the exceptions to this rule. When a new kind of technology or design is created in the field of robotics, it pushes the boundaries of what's possible in every aspect of living.

In modern times, these inventions are becoming more popular. More and more leading engineers and technologists are migrating to robotics fields. This puts robotics in a leading technological role.

# Stages
Just like anything, robots didn't start from nowhere. There have been a lot of stages leading into robotics.

### Mechanical Machines
The origins of robotics are a little bit difficult to track. This is because the modern "electrical mechanical device" just wasn't possible very far back in the past. So we can change the definition slightly, starting with "automatic mechanical device".

The [Aeolipile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeliopile) is the first recorded steam engine. It was developed all the way back in the 1st century AD.

Under the historic definition of "automatic mechanical device", an Aeolipile could be considered a robot.

The first recorded *programmable* device was Al-Jazari's [robot hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jazari#Musical_robot_band). It used the flow of water to create music on a drum. It could be adjusted to perform different songs.

Leonardo da Vinci is one of the first people to design a machine that performs actions without human interaction. His [mechanical knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo%27s_robot) is one of the first documented automations of human motion.

The [Karakuri ningyō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karakuri_ningyō) was also a very complex device that imitated human action. It was developed in the 17th century.

### Remote control
The late 1800s were a breeding ground for remote control technology. Pushed by a lot of wars around the world, there was a need to stop powerful navies. This came in the form of torpedoes. Interestingly, the technology that had to be developed in order for torpedoes to work is the same technology that pushed robotics forwards.

Nikola Tesla was the first person to develop a radio controlled torpedo.

### Science fiction
Thanks to a surge in technological abilities, people's imaginations were opened to the many possibilities. This led to an increase in science fiction novels, many of which depicted modern robots. ([full list of robots in science fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_robots_and_androids#Literature)) Thanks to electricity, these images started to become reality.

### Humanoids
Starting in the 1920s-1930s, robots became part of popular culture. [Elektro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektro), [Elmer and Elsie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_\(robot\)#Robots) and many others started to push the boundaries of what was possible.

### Industry
In 1956, the entire purpose of robots was flipped. [Unimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimate) demonstrated the potential uses for robots in industry, and that push has not since stopped.
