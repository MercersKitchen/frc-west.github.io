Signals come in all shapes and forms, and there are even more ways to interpret, convert or send those signals. Some examples of signals:

- PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
- Analog voltage
- Digital
- Wireless (802.11, radio, etc.)

**PWM** is a signal that is based on the "on-and-off" speed of a digital signal.

You can learn more about PWM [here](/courses/ELT1140/2-Programming/1-MotorControl/)

**Analog Voltage** is a broad range of topics, but we will focus on the general idea of changing output by adjusting voltage.

Generally, by changing a voltage of some kind of input, you can use that in a program to adjust a more important output - like motor speed.

For example, you can use a potentiometer to adjust a small voltage (eg. 1V). This small voltage can be read by a program, and the program can adjust the speed of a motor from that voltage. (ie. voltage=0.4V out of 1V - motor speed=40%)

**Digital** signals are a wide variety of possible ways to transmit data. These could be very simple - just an "on" or "off" signal. Or, they could be very complicated. USB, DVI, ethernet, etc. are all standards for cables that transmit digital signals, at high speeds.
