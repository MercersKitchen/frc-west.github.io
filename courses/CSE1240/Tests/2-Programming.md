### 1. A signal

+ powers an actuator
+ sends data
+ changes state of regulators
+ Any of the above

### 2. PWM is typically used for

+ Transferring byte values
+ Changing relative speed
+ Flickering output
+ Powering actuators

### 3. How would you adjust output speed for a motor using a knob?

+ Taking input voltage from the knob and adjusting speed according to it's relative speed
+ Taking input voltage from the motor and adjusting speed according to the knob's position
+ Taking speed from the motor and adding the knob's position
+ Taking input voltage from the knob and adjusting speed according to it's absolute position

### 4. What is not a quality of safe programming languages?

+ Strict type system
+ Error codes and descriptions
+ Restricted memory access
+ Compiling rules

### 5. Why is performance important in an embedded system language?

+ To react quickly to input
+ To have lots of features
+ Because of program overhead
+ To do tasks quickly

### 6. Why is C a common option for embedded systems?

+ Performance
+ Manual memory management
+ No object system
+ Ease of writing

### 7. What is byte code?

+ A programming language
+ A "half-compiled" version of source code
+ Assembly code without system calls
+ Code run by a virtual machine

### 8. What is usually sent to the system when deploying code?

+ Compiled version of source code files
+ Source code files
+ Compiled image file
+ Machine code files

### 9. When is it best to use PID control?

+ Keeping output consistent
+ Bringing output up to a setpoint
+ Turning on output for a time period
+ Performing an action a certain amount of times

### 10. In a closed-loop controller, input is always affected by previous output.

+ True
+ False
