### 1. Why would robot control software loop periodically?

+ To update output using new input
+ To prevent freezing
+ For more responsiveness
+ Because that is convention

### 2. What would not be considered part of structured programming?

+ Categorizing elements
+ Correct spacing
+ Proper naming schemes
+ Efficient methods

### 3. In Java, variables are defined as static after the constructor.

+ True
+ False

### 4. A control system includes the following elements

1. Battery
2. Robotic arm
3. Processor
4. Breakout board
5. Proximity sensor

-

+ All 5
+ 1, 2, 3, 4
+ 1, 3, 4, 5
+ 3, 4, 5

### 5. Actuators

+ Regulate current to a device
+ Create a signal for control
+ Perform a physical action
+ Move in or out

### 6. An embedded system is

+ Computer system with a dedicated purpose
+ A small processor
+ A non-programmable circuit
+ A compact computer system

### 7. What is the main difference between the roboRIO and cRIO?

+ Compactness
+ Internal specifications
+ Integrated elements
+ User and reset buttons

### 8. Which is not (or does not contain) a System on a Chip (SoC)?

+ roboRIO
+ Laptop
+ Rasberry pi
+ Android smartphone

### 9. What is the difference between FPGA and ASIC?

+ It's capacity to be reprogrammed
+ It's ability to do a certain task
+ It's speed
+ It's cost to manufacture

### 10. FPGA can rearrange it's internal logic circuits to perform a different task

+ True
+ False
