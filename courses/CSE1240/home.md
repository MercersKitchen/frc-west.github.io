**Prerequisite:**

    CSE1110: Structured Programming 1

**Description:**

    Students use an appropriate Robot Control Language (RCL) to design, develop, implement and debug robotics programs that employ standard structured programming constructs and simple data structures. In the process, they develop a general understanding of robots and the robotics environment.

**Parameters:**

    Access to appropriate computer equipment, software, support materials and the Internet. More specifically, students must have access to either the physical (real) or virtual (simulated) robotic environment they will require to design, write and debug RCL scripts or programs.
