You will need to make a log of your build season and competition at the bottom of the proposal.

ADLC does not officially support the Special Projects courses for FRC - you are likely better off to submit this proposal to your own school's principal or favourite teacher. Be sure to submit early, as approval can take some time.

This proposal is valid for Special Projects credits in the 10, 20, and 30 levels. You will need to adjust the submission each year, but it is reasonably straightforward.

For help in filling out and submitting this proposal, contact FRC West through [Joel Gallant](mailto:joel@frcwest.com).
