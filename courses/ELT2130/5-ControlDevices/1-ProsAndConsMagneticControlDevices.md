Using magnetic devices comes with drawbacks and advantages. Let's take an initial look at some of these qualities.

#### Advantages
- Reliable
- Costs
- Easy to build and maintain
- Performs complex functions easily
- Works almost irregardless of conditions

#### Disadvantages
- Slower than non-mechanical solutions
- Inefficient compared to new-age technology
- By nature of being mechanical, possible to break or wear out

This is a classic example of old-age versus new-age. Although most people prefer the high tech solutions because of their non-mechanical qualities, electromagnetic devices are not dead. They still have numerous advantages that make them a good choice for many applications.

If fact, electromagnetic devices like relays are still usually used for high voltage/current situations. If speed of actuation isn't a concern, they are still very cost effective - a transistor capable of the same high current would cost a lot of money.

Electromagnetic sensors are also good in certain situations. In sensor technology, having processes be physical is sometimes preferred. This makes qualities easier to measure and diagnose. If a sensor was solely electronic without any physical pieces, it would be very difficult to diagnose and repair.
