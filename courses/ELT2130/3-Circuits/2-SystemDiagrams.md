Circuit diagrams contain symbols for individual devices, and conductors (usually wires or traces).

If wires connect with each other, a dot is displayed.

When the conductors do not connect with each other, a "wave" on one wires shows that they do not touch.

A manual **switch** (on-off controlled by the user) is show like this:

A **resistor** is a device that applies a resistance between two conductors, resisting the flow of charge.

Resistors are measured in ohms. Usually, they are in the thousands (ie. 10K ohms).

For more information on Ohm's law, you should read [ELT2080](/courses/ELT2080/1-ControlSystem/2-CircuitsAndOhmsLaw/).

You can connect multiple resistors together. When in **series**, simply add the resistances together.

22000 + 33 = 22033 ohms.

You can also go **parallel**.

The value of the above parallel network is: R = 1/(1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3)

**Capacitors** have metal plates separated by an insulator. They temporarily store an electrical charge.

They are measured in Farad, usually in microfarads.

**Diodes** only permit the flow of charge in one direction.

**Integrated circuits** are symbols used to represent a more complicated circuit.

You might have studied **operational amplifiers** in [ELT2080](http://0.0.0.0:4000/courses/ELT2080/3-Devices/2-Semiconductors/).
