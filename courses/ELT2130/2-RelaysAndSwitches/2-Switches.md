An electromagnetic switch is a relay used for the purpose of turning a circuit on and off.

When a magnetic field is near the device, it turns on.

Switches exist that take advantage of this property. When a current is present, it powers a small coil that keeps the switch from turning off. When the current is lost, the switch turns off because of a lack of magnetic field. It will stay off until manually turned on again, acting as a safety mechanism.
