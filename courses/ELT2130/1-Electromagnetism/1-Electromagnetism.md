As a subatomic level, electromagnetism is the force that causes attraction and repulsion of electrically charged particles. It is fundamentally a simple idea - opposite charges attract and similar charges repulse.

When charged particles move, they create a magnetic field. When moving quickly (ie. vibrating or oscillating), they create electromagnetic radiation.

The idea of electromagnetism goes beyond thinking about simply charged ions and metals. Remember, that *moving charges* create a magnetic field. Now, relate that to the idea of **electricity**.

As electricity moves through a wire, a magnetic field is created. This is the basic idea of a **electromagnet**. Usually, electromagnets use coils to concentrate the magnetic field in a desired direction.

As you likely already know, the opposite effect works as well. Moving a magnet along a wire will induce a current in that wire. That is how generators work.
