Flowcharts are a visual medium largely used in programming. They show you how the "flow" of the program works - what happens when and why.

But the usefulness of flowcharts is not really limited to the programming sphere. As a matter of fact, they can often be less useful in programming.

But how would you create a flowchart otherwise - what would you use it for and how would it work? Here are some examples:

- Looking at control system flow; how the processes work together
- Exploring the nature of input to output
- Understanding how systems interact with each other

What we really want to do is explore the nature of how a system works. Let's use the example of a car.

The green boxes are "user input", and they all somehow affect the wheels. This model is a good example of how you can visually demonstrate the flow of input to output - you can see how all of your input as the driver is some way or another translated into output in the wheels.

You might also add a turn signal into the equation.

And, this is not a completely independent system. Your turn signal is turned off when you turn your steering wheel in the correct direction. You can see this relationship by adding the flowchart to the entire system.

You can imagine this flowchart becoming very complicated with every system on the vehicle. Our first and third original points are demonstrated using the turn signal example.
