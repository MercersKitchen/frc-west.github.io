Using a variety of sensors, control elements and actuators, create a robot that is able to move into (but not touching) a wall, and back into its original position.

You can use:

- VEX Robotics kit
- FRC robot
- Lego mindstorm
- RobotOpen Arduino

And any sensors, motors, etc. that you can find.

Requirements:

- Demonstrate it's abilities using two different walls and distances
- Make a one page writeup explaining how and why it works, including a description of each sensor used
