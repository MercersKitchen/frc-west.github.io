Thermal sensors measure the temperature of the air around them. The most common temperature sensor is the **thermistor**.

Thermistors are resistors that are sensitive to temperature changes. Because of this physical quality, they are good for detecting temperature. By measuring voltage of a current running through a thermistor (because resistance changes voltage), we can detect temperature - fairly precisely too.

Thermal sensors are used for various reasons, including giving readable temperatures to a user, regulating heat, changing temperature-sensitive devices, safety switches, etc. Computers use temperature sensors to measure the heat of it's components (ie. CPU, Graphics card, etc.)
