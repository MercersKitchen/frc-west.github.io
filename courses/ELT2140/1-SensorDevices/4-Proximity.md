Proximity sensors are highly useful, especially in the field of robotics. Knowing the distance to or from another object can be crucial information.

Typically, proximity sensors use light. Some are infrared, some use lasers, but generally light is a good indicator of distance. Ultrasonic sensors are also used, utilizing radio or sound waves.

There are two elements to a proximity sensor - the transmitter and receiver. These two devices work together, and are located in basically the same place. The reflection of the signal sent from the transmitter is detected by the receiver.
