A photoelectric sensor is used to detect light. It transmits a beam of light, often infrared, and detects that light using a photoelectric receiver. Different technologies use different methods to do this - some have two devices, one on either end of the light, while others use the light's reflection to detect distance. These methods have different accuracies and uses.

#### Opposed
An opposed arrangement contains two elements - the receiver and the transmitter, which are separate devices. This arrangement detects when something is in the way of the beam.

You can think of this as the "laser sensor" seen in spy movies.

#### Retro-reflective
Retro-reflective devices utilizes some kind of reflective material. An object is detected when the beam of light does not come back to the receiver.

Retroreflective materials reflect light in the direction of the source - wherever the light came from, it bounces back in the same direction.

#### Proximity-sensing
A proximity sensing sensor does the opposite of opposed and retro-reflective modes. It detects an object when light actually *does* reflect back, instead of the opposite. Effectively, it measures if light takes a shorter time to return to the source.

## Pros and cons
**Opposed** mode is the most accurate and reliable of the three. It will rarely falsely report what is happening. But, it is costly and inefficient. Two devices are required, and installation is more complicated.

**Retro-reflective** is a good compromise. Although there are still two points on the system, one of them costs a lot less than a receiver (reflective surface).

And finally, **proximity-sensing** is the choice reserved for two reasons - price and flexibility. Essentially, it costs less because it has less parts. And you are not limited by having to have two points on the system - it can go anywhere you want without having to worry about what's on the other side.
