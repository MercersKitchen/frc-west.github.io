Tactile sensors measure a physical interaction with the environment. They are generally based on touch, or weight.

The obvious and most common tactile sensor is the switch.

There are different kinds of switches. Buttons, like the picture above, are common on user devices. Other types of switches also exist.

Generally, switches are "on-off" - they only have two states.

Other tactile sensors also exist. Touch screens, pressure sensors, dimmers, etc. are all good examples.
