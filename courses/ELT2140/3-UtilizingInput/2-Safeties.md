Any system that will be used for a potentially dangerous purpose is a liability to those designing it. It is absolutely critical for engineers to take precautions about their designs in any physical system.

This is not limited to obvious, common practices. Safety is also a crucial part of control system design.

#### Software
You've probably heard of software bugs that cause huge real-life effects. These bugs are not always preventable, sometimes they can slip by. But, there is actually a great deal of "safety" in software.

By safety, we mean to say that there is a fair amount of code that is specifically meant to deal with errors or problems that arise when running. This code is different depending on what field you're in. For example, a nuclear power plant's software would not try to restart it's facilities after a major error, but a robotic vacuum cleaner likely would.

#### Hardware
Various types of safeties exist in electronic circuits and physical systems to prevent mistakes. Some might be simple, like a mechanical stop on an arm (literally a piece of material that blocks it from moving further). The usual quality of a hardware safety is that it is simple.

A complicated safety system rarely helps protect from any real damage. By nature, if something is failing, it is likely that the complicated thing will fail first. You wouldn't want your actual safety mechanism to fail, it is almost an oxymoron.

Commonly, fuses and breakers are used in circuits as safety measures. These will stop the flow of electricity at a certain amperage, usually caused by a short in the circuit.

Limit switches and integrated sensors are also a common safety. You might used a sensor to detect if your air pressure is 60PSI, and have that sensor directly wire into the compressor. This would prevent the flow of electricity when air pressure reaches its limit.
