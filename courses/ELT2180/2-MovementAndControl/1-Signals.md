Signals are how programs control a physical system. They are meant to be interpreted by a physical device, usually in the goal of achieving some kind of movement.

In simulation, signals are the difference between a physical reality and a simulated one. Signals are sent to different things in a simulation, usually they are not even electrically generated and instead are simply digitally rerouted to another piece of software.
