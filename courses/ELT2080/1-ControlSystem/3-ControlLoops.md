You looked at control loops in [ELT1080](/courses/ELT1080/1-ControlSystem/5-InputtoOutput/), and saw PID control and how real control systems use a variety of inputs and outputs to perform complicated tasks.

We also recommend reading [this page](/courses/CSE1240/5-Input,OutputAndProgrammingMethodology/1-ControlLoops/) from CSE1240 for a good idea of the different kinds of control loops.

Control systems make a lot of use of control loops, especially those that utilize feedback.
