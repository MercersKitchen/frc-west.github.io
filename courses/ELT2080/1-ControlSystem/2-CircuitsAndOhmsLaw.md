Ohm's law is simple.

where I is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, V is the potential difference measured across the conductor in units of volts, and R is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms.

This leads to the following conclusions

Think of it like a triangle.

So what does all of it mean?

In this circuit, we start to understand how the elements interact with each other. Let's draw some simple conclusions.

- V (voltage) is directly proportional to I (amperage) and R (resistance)
- By raising R, we decrease I (constant V)
- By raising V, we increase I (constant R)

You can not adjust I by itself.
