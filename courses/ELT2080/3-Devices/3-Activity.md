Your goal is simple for this activity, but the process will be difficult.

##### Goals
- Create a small (no larger than 8x8") vehicle capable of moving using electric motors
- Use some kind of sensor and circuit (no programming!) to prevent the vehicle from hitting walls in front of it

It is fine for your vehicle to move forwards at all times (when it's on), provided it stops for walls.

**Some hints**

- Try to find the simplest solution possible
- If you're adventurous, try out a proximity sensor (no programming!)
