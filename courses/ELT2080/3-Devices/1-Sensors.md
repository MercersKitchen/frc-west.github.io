##### Thermistor
Thermistors are resistors that are sensitive to temperature changes. Because of this physical quality, they are good for detecting temperature. By measuring voltage of a current running through a thermistor (because resistance changes voltage), we can detect temperature - fairly precisely too.

##### Pressure Sensor
Pressure sensors measure the force exerted by a compressed gas or liquid. This technology is varied across an estimated 50 different methods, and the format of the measurement also differs between sensors. For information about all of these technologies, see [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_sensor) for more.

##### Photoelectric Transducer
A photoelectric sensor is used to detect the distance to an object. It transmits a beam of light, often infrared, and detects that light using a photoelectric receiver. Different technologies use different methods to do this - some have two devices, one on either end of the light, while others use the light's reflection to detect distance. These methods have different accuracies and uses.

##### Hall Effect
Hall effect is the opposite effect of electromagnetism. Basically, moving a magnet past a coil will induce an electric current in that coil. We use this to our advantage, usually in moving systems. We attach a magnet to a moving piece, and measure a current in a coil that is close to where that magnet passes.

##### Optocoupler
Optocouplers are basically "light transistors". Effectively, they contain two parts: 1. An LED circuit 2. A phototransistor to receive light. They are mainly used as a switching device to transfer pulse signals.

##### Bar Code
Bar codes are encoded series of numbers in bars of different widths. They are scanned by simple optical sensors which detect the lines, and software decodes the numbers behind those lines.

##### Light Controller Resistors
Photoresistors are normal resistors, but with the variable resistance depending on the exposure to light. This can be used as a sensor to detect if light is present, and how much.

##### LED
You know of LEDs as Light Emitting Diodes - small light sources that are efficient and found in all kinds in electronics. LEDs can act as photoresistors/photodiodes - they are sensitive to wavelengths equal to or shorter than the predominant wavelength it emits.

##### Photodiode
A photodiode converts light into current. These are commonly used for solar power panels.

##### Proximity Switches
Proximity switches detect nearby objects without any physical contact. Often, these will use photoelectric sensors. They will emit a signal, and detect changes in the field or return signal.
