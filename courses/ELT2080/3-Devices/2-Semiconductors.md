##### Rectifiers
A rectifier converts Alternating Current into Direct Current. Rectifiers take many forms, including vacuum tube diodes, mercury-arc valves, copper and selenium oxide rectifiers, etc. Because by nature, AC current contains pulses of differing voltage, some devices require more than simply a rectifier for DC current. To make a steady voltage, an electronic filter is used.

##### Field-effect Transistor
Field-effect transistors are basically the same as explained in the video above. See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor) for more information.

##### Silicon Controlled Rectifier Transistors
See [here](http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/power/thyristor.html) for information.

##### Unijunction Transistors

    A junction transistor (UJT) is a three-lead electronic semiconductor device with only one junction that acts exclusively as an electrically controlled switch. The UJT is not used as a linear amplifier. It is used in free-running oscillators, synchronized or triggered oscillators, and pulse generation circuits at low to moderate frequencies (hundreds of kilohertz). 

##### Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-effect Transistor
The MOSFET is a transistor used for amplifying or switching electronic signals.

##### Thyristor
For information about Thyristors, including DIACs and TRIACs, see [here](http://www.electronics-radio.com/articles/electronic_components/scr/what-is-a-thyristor.php)

##### Timers
The 555 timer Integrated Circuit is used to generate an oscillating signal. For information about it's features and schematics, see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC).

##### Operational Amplifiers
Operational amplifiers do exactly what their name implies - they amplify a signal. Theoretically, an open-loop gain can be infinite - meaning amplification could be infinite given enough time. Of course, this is impractical because of the physical properties of the component. 

##### Solid-state Relays
Solid-state relays aren't very different from mechanical relays, except for how they are made. They have no moving parts, which makes them more efficient, small and longer lasting. See more [here](http://www.ia.omron.com/support/guide/18/overview.html)
