An important part of computer science that needs to be understood is the actual platform and industry that has brought us to where we are today. In the 1960's, it was very very different to learn computer science - as a matter of fact it was probably impossible for the vast majority of people.

Now, you probably have 3 or 4 computers within reaching distance that all contain more computing power than anything 20 (maybe even 10) years ago! The dramatic shift in abilities and size of computers has changed the world permanently.

This was no accident. Thousands of people have contributed in one way or another to this enormous shift. And, as it usually follows in modern times, this shift is largely because of capitalism. Had computers not been useful for work, it might not have had enough traction to become mainstream.

## The Personal Computer
For an interesting look at the past of personal computing, see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuBXbvl1Sg4&list=PLudrw8Z7-gFa7Is4YZitOF7-AfLl2u8IA) documentary.

The personal computer is the traditional model for what a "computer" really is. To most people, this is still their understanding.

PCs are extremely popular, but have slowed down sales in the past 5 years. A report from the US census [shows](http://www.census.gov/hhes/computer/files/2012/Computer_Use_Infographic_FINAL.pdf) that in 2012, 78.9% of all households have a computer. This saturation in combination with the extreme growth of smartphones has led to lower numbers than seen before. Of course, this was to be expected. 

## Mobile Technology
70.6% of adults aged 25-34 used smartphones in the US in 2012. This number is growing at a high rate. The evolution of mobile technology has seen steep climbs in market share.

This is because of the convenience that mobile technology gives people. This may be the first time in the history of computing that the technology is truly adapting to our needs, instead of the opposite. In the past, it was common for people to believe that computers were more of a hassle than something that makes life easier. To now have a small device in your pocket capable of doing anything you need it to is a shift in the right direction.

## Networks & the Internet
Arguably, all the previously mentioned technologies might not have had any success without the internet.
