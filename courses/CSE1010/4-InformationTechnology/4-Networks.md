Internal networks (LAN - Local Area Network) and external networks (WAN - Wide Area Network) are important in the workflow of people, companies and servers.

Networks have many different uses, but mainly:

- Share files
- Transfer information live
- Backup important information
- Serve content

Networks share files using standard protocols. FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SAMBA are all examples of standards used by many systems to transfer files over a network. Usually, there is more overhead on these kinds of connections because every single bit of information is crucial to get to the other end.

Live information is done differently, and even more variation exists depending on the purpose. Something like database entries from a cash register would have the same safeties as a file transfer, because any mistakes could result in money lost. But something like an online video game would treat data differently. Much more importantly than validity of data is the speed it comes through. Video games will be perfectly content with missing packets of data as long as it comes in quickly.

Backing up information over a network is a safe and efficient way to make sure data is never lost. Hard drives fail, and the more of them you have, the more likely something will go wrong. If there is a way to have multiple copies of your files, it can help enormously when hardware fails. Even something like a fire or flood could be very dangerous, which is why off-site backups are common.

Serving content is also like file sharing, although it could be much more complicated. Most webpages contain information from multiple sources, so one file is not enough to get what you want. There are ways to make this process more efficient, like caching and standardizing library locations (eg. Google's jquery).
