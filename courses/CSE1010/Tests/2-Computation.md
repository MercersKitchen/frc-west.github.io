### 1. What is the main question posed by the Theory of Computation?

+ What problems can be solved by a computer?
+ What kind of computer can solve any problem?
+ How long does a computer take to solve problems?
+ What problems are unsolvable?

### 2. What is the Turing Machine?

+ A computer built by Alan Turing
+ A model for computers capable of solving any given problem
+ A model for machines capable of simulating logic of any computer algorithm
+ A computer capable of running logical simulations

### 3. How could the following program be simplified?

    define s as 0
    for all numbers within 1 and 10:
        define s as s plus number
    
+ Using only addition
+ Using only multiplication
+ It cannot
+ Either A or B

### 4. What are algorithms used for?

+ Executing a set of instructions
+ Evaluation a function
+ Keeping time
+ Processing output based on input

### 5. If an algorithms were `O(log n)`, what is the implication?

+ There are log n possible outputs
+ There will be a logarithmic amount of time/steps taken
+ The function is better run with low inputs
+ The function is better run with high inputs

### 6. Why do different methods of sorting take different amounts of time?

+ Because computers are better at certain things
+ Because CPUs are optimized towards certain methods
+ Because time taken is random
+ Because different amounts of steps are taken

### 7. Why might someone opt for a `O(n^2)` algorithm instead of a `O(n + 2)` algorithm which accomplishes the same thing?

+ For simplicity
+ If performance doesn't matter
+ If `n` is lower than 2
+ All of the above

### 8. Is the following problem NP?

    Find the sum of all factors of `n`

+ Yes
+ No


### 9. What is the difference between linear and concurrent programming?

+ Linear programming is more efficient
+ Concurrent programming performs multiple actions at once
+ Memory is more volatile in concurrent programming
+ Linear programming has no performance issues

### 10. What is the main challenge of concurrency?

+ CPU thermal capacity
+ Effectively dividing tasks
+ Accessing & changing something at the same time
+ Timing processes
