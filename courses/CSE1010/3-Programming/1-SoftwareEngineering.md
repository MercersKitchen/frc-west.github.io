An important part of understanding computers is how exactly we take advantage of them. This is not limited to our usage of existing software, and is much more interesting in the context of new development.

Software engineering is the process of creating software for computers. Ultimately, the goal of this software is to benefit humans in some way. There are a variety of kinds of programs - some examples are:

- User interfaces (Graphical programs meant for day-to-day usage)
- Mobile programs (Programs meant for usage on smaller portable devices)
- Backend programs (Programs meant to manage information or provide a service to others)
- Kernels / firmware (Programs meant to abstract away the basic function of the device)
- Libraries (Programs that are only useful when called by other programs - remove redundancy of writing the same functions over and over)
- Compilers (Programs that turn things written in languages into computer machine code)

Programming is an evolutionary process. As we continue to make new and interesting programs to solve new problems, our toolkits become larger and larger.

In a sense, we are building on the fundamental pieces of software written 30-40 years ago. It's important to understand that you wouldn't be able to do something like printing a message to the screen almost 50 years ago. Now, a program in python to do that looks like this:

    print "Message"

The possibilities are endless, which is why computers and programming are a growing and expanding industry.
