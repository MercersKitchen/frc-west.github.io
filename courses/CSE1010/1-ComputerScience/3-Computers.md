The CPU is not the only important part of a computer. As a matter of fact, you wouldn't have much use for such a thing. At most, you might be able to do some simple math (provided you have power, input and a way to see output).

The "computer" is a combination. It is a sum of parts, making up something that anyone can use without intimate knowledge of what's happening inside.

So you have a screen, keyboard, mouse and CPU. What else is required?

Think of the different parts as "utilities", things that the user can use for their own benefit at any time. Similar to the human body, certain sections are more often used than other.

**Power Supply**

Like your heart, the computer is dead without a power supply. In a traditional desktop, this is a device which converts the AC power from your wall into regulated useful power to the different components on the computer. In a laptop, this could be the battery.

**RAM**

Like your short term memory, this stores information that needs to be used in the near future. Constant power is needed to keep memory on RAM. After turning off the computer, RAM storage is no longer usable.

**Hard Drive**

This is long term storage. You are in control of what gets stored here, and what to delete, move, etc. There are two main kinds of hard drives - flash storage and disk storage. Flash is faster and more efficient, but does not have the same memory capacity as disk drives.

**Microprocessor**

Like your brain, it processes the input given through RAM, memory and peripherals. We have mostly talked about computers in the context of processors.

**Video/Sound Card**

Outputs for video and sound, these can do the processing required to make video and sound useful to humans. They can reduce strain on the microprocessor. These are optional components - you might not need sound or video, or they may be integrated into existing hardware (eg. intel built-in graphics on CPU).

## Software
It's important to note that a computer is functionally useless without software. Software involves a few different layers.

The **operating system** is a piece of software that is very close to system level, meaning it deals with hardware directly. Examples of Operating Systems are [Windows](http://windows.microsoft.com/), [OSX](https://www.apple.com/ca/osx/), [BSD](http://www.bsd.org/), [Linux/GNU](http://www.linuxmint.com/), etc.

The **HW Abstraction Layer** is a way for the programs running on your computer to access hardware functionality (ie. sound, advanced graphics). The layer is given to increase performance of critical applications (eg. video games).

The **OS Adaptation Layer** is a way for your programs to interact with the operating system to make things more efficient. Things like generating random numbers, writing files, etc. are all useful OS features. Most of what computer applications do somehow ties in with this layer.
