Build season is a 6 week period that you have to prototype, design, source, build, test, program and practice with your robot.

A typical build season looks like this:

### Week 1
Game discussion, prototyping, initial programming, start of design

Usually, teams will take the first week to go over the direction they want to go in for the first week. This includes how they will play the game, using prototypes to find effective designs and some initial programming. Generally, you will focus on the strategy and not design yet.

### Week 2
Designing, finishing prototyping, electronics

Week 2 usually contains a lot of designing and final prototypes. This is when the decisions about how your robot works happens. With an idea of what everything will look like, electronics can start some initial work.

### Week 3
Fabrication, electronics

At this point, the robot is starting to be made. Not much will be put together, but the design is final. Electronics can continue to be made, and since most things are finalized they can basically do most of their work.

### Week 4
Fabrication

This is a flexible week - some teams will be behind schedule by this point, and some will be ahead. Generally, fabrication of parts will take place.

### Week 5
Assembly, programming, electronics

The robot starts to be put together by this point. Programming can start initial testing and features, and electronics can be put in the robot.

### Week 6
Testing, programming

It's not completely common for teams to be on track by week 6, but if they are, they will do testing and practice during this time. Autonomous modes and advanced features will be worked out.
