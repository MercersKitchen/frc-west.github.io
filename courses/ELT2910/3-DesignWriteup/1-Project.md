Your assignment for ELT2910 is to do a design writeup. You are flexible to do as you wish format wise, and feel free to add as much detail as you can. Be sure to format in a readable way, and be creative. Use pictures or videos where appropriate, and add all details about your team that made it unique and outstanding.

FRC isn't just about the final product - it's the journey you took to get there. Ideally, you should complete this course as you are in build season, to remember exactly how the process went.
