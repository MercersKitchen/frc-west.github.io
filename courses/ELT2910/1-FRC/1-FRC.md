This course will be a measurement of your FRC season. If you have not completed [ELT1910](/courses/ELT1910/home), please do so before this one. This should be your second year as an FRC student.

### Overview of FRC
The FIRST Robotics Competition is an international high school robotics competition organized by FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). Each year, teams of high school students compete to build robots weighing up to 120 pounds (54 kg), not including battery and bumpers, that can complete a task, which changes every year. While teams are given a standard set of parts, they are also allowed a budget and encouraged to buy or make specialized parts as long as they conform to FIRST safety rules. Game details are revealed at the beginning of January and the teams are given six weeks to construct a competitive robot, that can operate autonomously as well as when guided by wireless controls, to accomplish the game's tasks.

### Robots
FRC robots are typically washing machine sized, and 100-120lbs. They are complex and perform difficult tasks.

All of the following examples are very high calibre robots. They demonstrate the "cream of the crop" in what is possible.
